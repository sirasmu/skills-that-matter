Self improvement - Reflection and findings

Hi, I am not entirely sure what I want to do with this repo yet. Maybe throw in some cool diagrams, articles, my thoughts on my findings, cool code snippets. As I said I am not sure. However, I do think it is important that I write and document more. So the knowledge from today wont be lost by tomorrow.
