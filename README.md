Self improvement - Reflection and findings

Hi, I am not entirely sure what I want to do with this repo yet. Maybe throw in some cool diagrams, articles, my thoughts on my findings, cool code snippets. As I said I am not sure. However, I do think it is important that I write and document more, so the knowledge from today wont be lost by tomorrow.

So I was wondering what type of developer do I want to be? Which skills should I focus on? Currently I am learning Vim, but isn't that kind of an useless skill? Well it is not, because it is good to know a terminal based editor. I also see a benefit for writing notes in Markdown. Should I learn Emacs/Spacemacs? Well, I don't know. I think then I should consider which kind of workplace I would like to fit into and which languages I would like to use. Being a .NET developer it just makes sense to be using Visual Studio. However, I do not wish to be trapped within one environment. Do I care too much about tools? Probably yes. I should focus more on creating. Here are some languages that I have considered learning:

* C - I just really like C. I honestly don't really feel attracted to object oriented languges after I started working with C. There is minimal magic going on behind the scenes. It is just sort of beautiful and does not seem bloated.
* Python - Seems interesting. I have written a few small Python programs, but I do not feel like I am knowledgeable
* C# - A powerfull tool. I should become better at .NET
* Bash - Honestly I just want to learn more about shell scripts
* GO - I know nothing, but it seems interesting
* Rust - Heard well of it. Probably something I should look into when I am more experienced

Ok, so maybe it would be worth it for me to look into something like Spacemacs. Obviously not for C#. Also I quite like Atmel Studio for C and Assembly. I might also consider going into C++. I have been reading the book `Coders at Work` recently and no one seemed to like C++. I think beginners should start with object oriented languages so that they can form their mental model around that concept, but I am not sure that I actually would like to stay within the object oriented world. I should probably still become more well aquinted with C++. 

So far I have used Vim for Python and Bash. As such I think it might be worth it to learn Spacemacs. Today I saw a quite interesting video on the usage of git together with Spacemacs, which seemed very appealing to me. One of the reasons I wanted to learn Vim was so that I would not have to leave the terminal, which makes it more confortable to update git repositories right away after editing a file.

These are my muddied thoughts from today. I think I kind of care about the wrong things though, but it was great to try to sought out some my thoughts. For the next while I will probably mostly work with C# and Javascript, though. At least that is what I exspect that will be required of me. I don't think I like dynamic types, but maybe I will like Javascript once I have become more experienced. I just found the language to be kind of messy. That is maybe because it was one of the first languages I worked with and thus it troublesome that it was seemingly less structured.
